The Art and Audio folders are separate from the repository to save space and download time from github, each major new release will include a new rar package in the ARCHIVE folder, each indev update will include the current changes in the INDEV folder in uncompressed Art and Audio folders. Every finished versions Art and Audio files will be turned into a new rar file and placed inside a new version folder in ARCHIVE.
